TODO 
 - how would it the code differ if it was object-oriented instead of
   procedural?
   - write tests to cover what you have
   - make modifications for object oriented
   - look at:
     - https://github.com/fgregg/legistar-scrape/blob/master/legistar/scraper.py
     - https://github.com/mcepl/gg_scraper/blob/master/gg_scraper.py
     - 

 - add logging
 - add CLI parser
